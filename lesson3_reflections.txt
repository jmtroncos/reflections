When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to share my repository and invite other people to collaborate on it

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because there might be changes made to the remote that I don't want in my local until I am sure that I agree with those changes,
  This is relevant when there is more than one people with direct access to the remote.
