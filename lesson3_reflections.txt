When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to share my repository and invite other people to collaborate on it

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because there might be changes made to the remote that I don't want in my local until I am sure that I agree with those changes,
  This is relevant when there is more than one people with direct access to the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  A fork is a copy of a git repository from one Github account to another. It is the best way of hacking into a repository we are interested in
  without disturbing the original author's repository, but still linking back to it so as to give due credit. Clones are similar to forks,
  except that they work from a remote (github) to a local (laptop) repository, or from local to local. 
  Branches are a deviation from a repository's line of commits, so as to implement a new or experimental feature that we do not want to include
  in it yet (or at all) until we are fully satisfied with its results. Branches are parts of a repository.
