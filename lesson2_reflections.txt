What happens when you initialize a repository? why do you need to do it?

  A new hidden directory (.git) is created inside the current directory. It needs to be initialized for git to know that this will be a new git 
  repository, and that we want to keep track of changes in this directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is an intermediate logical place where we add the files that will be included in the next commit to our repository.
